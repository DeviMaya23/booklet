## Decision Boundaries

Before introducing a new pattern, new abstraction, new dependency, 
or new layer boundary not already present in the codebase, stop and 
propose it to me first. Do not proceed until confirmed.

## Mid-Implementation Adaptations

If, while implementing a task, you discover that something not covered by the design is needed — a structural workaround, a bridging type, a scope change, an unanticipated dependency — stop and inform me before proceeding. Describe what you found, why the adaptation is needed, and what you're proposing. Do not implement it silently.


## OpenSpec Proposals

- Before starting a new proposal, pull the latest main branch and checkout from there
- Branch name format: `feat/<spec-name-here>`
- Generate each artifact during proposal step by step. Confirm with me before moving on to the next one.

### Unit Testing in proposals

- Always plan for unit tests on the usecase and handler layers
- Do not write unit tests for SQL repositories, only do integration tests
- Follow the unit testing rules in CONVENTIONS.md — they define what scenarios are worth writing and what test doubles to use
- Do not default to one success + one failure per function; write only the scenarios that have a reason to exist per the conventions

#### Assertion quality
- If a function returns a result, assert the result — not just the error
- Failure scenarios must assert the specific error type or message, not just that an error occurred

### Backend handler input processing

- Prefer `c.Bind` + `c.Validate` over manual parsing and validation for body and query params
- Use `uuid.Parse` manually only for path params, where `c.Bind` does not apply
- Before converting a field to a typed value (e.g. `uuid.UUID`), check whether the code actually needs that type. If nothing downstream requires the typed form, keep the field as `string` and validate with a govalidator tag instead — this preserves `c.Bind` compatibility and avoids unnecessary conversion

### Others to keep in mind during proposals
- When a change modifies a shared contract (a function signature, API endpoint, hook, etc.), grep for every call site of that symbol across all layers (backend, frontend, extension) before finalizing Impact/Capabilities/tasks — do not rely on a named flow (e.g. "the upload flow") to be exhaustive, as parallel entry points (e.g. drag-and-drop vs. modal vs. batch upload) commonly funnel into the same shared function and are easy to miss.
- When creating tasks for a new endpoint, always include a bruno file creation.
- On any BE development, include a task to run golang-ci lint at the end, and fix whatever issue arises.
- On any FE development, include a task to run npm run build and npm run lint at the end, and fix whatever issue arises.
