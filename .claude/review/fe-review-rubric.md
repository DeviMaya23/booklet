# Frontend review rubric

Stack: React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui on `@base-ui/react`, TanStack Query.

This file is the single source of truth for both the `fe-reviewer` subagent and the `/review-fe` command. Edit it here, not in those files.

## How to review

- **Flag, don't fix.** Report findings only. Never edit code files.
- **Plain language.** The reader is strong in Go and still learning React. For each finding say: what is wrong, why it hurts later, and (where one fits) a short Go analogy.
- **Cite `file:line`** for every finding.
- **Severity tiers**, in this order:
  1. **Bug**: wrong or fragile behavior now (stale data, broken a11y, crash on empty data).
  2. **Debt**: works today but makes future changes costly (duplication, misplaced code, redundant state).
  3. **Style**: preference only. Keep to at most three of these, or skip them.
- **Justify-or-flag.** For every `useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useRef` in scope, state in one line why it exists. Flag any you cannot justify.
- **Don't pad.** If a section has no findings, say so in one line. Do not invent findings to look thorough.

## Modes

There are two modes. The caller says which. If the request names paths to audit, use audit mode. Otherwise use diff mode.

### Diff mode (default)

- Scope: changed lines under `frontend/`, plus the sibling components and hooks they touch, read only to judge consistency.
- Tag every finding **new** (introduced by this diff) or **pre-existing** (already in the code the diff touches or sits beside, not introduced by it). List new findings first.
- Do not review code the diff does not touch.

### Audit mode

- Scope: the named files or directories, read in full. No git diff.
- No new/pre-existing tag. Everything is existing code.
- **Group findings by pattern, not by file.** The same mistake in N places is one finding: name the pattern, give the count, and list every `file:line`. Order patterns by tier, then by number of occurrences.
- End with a **suggested fix order**: which pattern to fix first and why (real bugs first, then patterns that cause future bugs, then duplication in the most-used files). Skip Style findings entirely.
- In the hook and state audit, list only the unjustified ones, not every hook in scope.

## 1. Project rules (check mechanically)

Placement
- Feature-specific code lives in `features/<feature>/{components,hooks,lib}`. `app-shell/` is only for shell layout and cross-feature orchestration. `lib/` is for shared domain modules used by 4+ features.
- Promote to shared layers only when a second feature actually needs it. Flag speculative promotion.
- Feature directory names stay distinct from `lib/` domain names (`folder-sidebar`, `right-panel`, not `folders`, `images`).

Hooks and components
- One hook per cohesive concern (state + its effects + its handlers). A concern can be described in one sentence without mentioning the rest of the component. Flag components that own several concerns inline.
- Hooks return semantic mutators (`removeImage(id)`, `toggleFlip()`), never raw setters (`setImages`).
- Related DOM handlers a hook exposes are grouped in one spreadable object (like `dragHandlers`).
- New hooks and extracted components have a colocated test file written in the same change. Hooks that attach to a DOM ref are tested through a small harness component, not bare `renderHook`.
- New dialogs, confirmations, and nav rows match the shape of existing siblings: `{ item: T | null, onCancel, onConfirm }` or `{ open, onCancel, onConfirm }`.
- No new shared abstraction (e.g. a generic `ConfirmDialog` in `components/ui/`) on the first or second occurrence. Two similar feature-owned components are fine. Reach for a shared base on the third.
- Reusable JSX is not stored in local variables (`const filtersContent = <div>...</div>`). Extract a component with explicit props. A closure-captured JSX variable hides what it depends on and cannot be tested alone. Flag it as Debt, and as a Bug risk if the same variable is rendered in more than one place (both copies mount, which can duplicate IDs and effects).

Duplication
- A multi-step flow (validate, transform, upload, finalize) used from more than one place belongs in `lib/` as one function. Flag copy-pasted flows.
- Near-identical components should share a generic implementation with thin wrappers. The bar is drift risk (a fix would need to land in N places), not file length.

State
- Local state that re-syncs from a prop via `useEffect` is **legitimate** if it holds an optimistic or in-flight value that must diverge from the prop. It is a **smell** if the state is purely derived. The fix there is `useMemo` or a `key` remount.
- Ref-mirrors-latest-state effects and DOM-measurement reset effects are legitimate.
- Where a library erases your data's shape to `any` (e.g. dnd-kit `Active.data.current`), prefer a small local type guard back to the project's union.

Libraries and lint
- No imports from `@radix-ui/*`. Base UI is the primitive layer; check `@base-ui` docs, not Radix.
- Use `onClick`, not `onSelect`, on `ContextMenuItem`.
- No `eslint-disable` comments. The only exception is `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, and it needs a comment explaining why.

## 2. Generic checks (not yet written down as project rules)

Responsive layout
- Desktop vs mobile differences should be one component with Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, ...). Flag `useMediaQuery`, `window.innerWidth`, or `isMobile ? <A /> : <B />` unless there is a stated reason. Duplicate trees mean every change has to be made twice.
- Flag layout that only works at one width: fixed pixel widths, missing `min-w-0` on flex children, overflow with no scroll container, hover-only interactions with no touch alternative.

Dialogs and modals
- Use the Base UI / shadcn dialog primitive. Flag hand-rolled overlays, or code that bypasses the primitive's focus trap, Escape handling, or scroll lock.
- Check focus returns to the trigger on close, and that the modal has an accessible title.
- Check state resets correctly when the modal reopens with different data.

Server state (TanStack Query)
- Data fetching goes through `useQuery` / `useMutation`. Flag `useEffect` + `fetch` + `useState`.
- Flag server data copied into `useState` (except the optimistic-buffer case above).
- Flag `data = []` style defaults on query results that are then used to decide "empty". Loading and empty are different states; gate on `isPending` / `isError` first.
- Flag local `isSubmitting`-style state that duplicates a mutation's `isPending`.
- Mutations must invalidate or update every query whose data they change. Flag a mutation with no `onSuccess` invalidation or cache update.
- Query keys must be consistent and include every variable the query depends on. Flag keys built ad hoc inline in several places.
- Flag `enabled` flags or `select` functions that silently hide errors.

Loading, error, empty
- Every data-driven view handles loading, error, and empty. Flag views that render `undefined` data or only the happy path.

TypeScript hygiene
- Flag `any`, `as` casts (especially `as unknown as`), and non-null `!`. Each needs a reason or a type guard.
- Flag props typed wider than they need to be, and optional props that are always passed.

React fundamentals
- Flag `useEffect` that does not synchronize with something external (derived values, event responses, prop-to-state copying).
- Flag two pieces of state that must always agree, or state that duplicates props or query data.
- Flag array `key` props that use index on reorderable or deletable lists.
- Flag inline object/array/function props passed to memoized children, or `useMemo`/`useCallback` with no measured need.
- Flag components over roughly 200 lines that mix fetching, form state, and layout. Length alone is not a finding, so cite the mixed concerns.

## 3. Running rules

Frontend rules live in the `## Frontend` section of `CONVENTIONS.md` (also check `CLAUDE.md` if it has frontend rules). Treat every rule there as part of section 1. When the reader accepts a finding as a standing rule, a line is added to that section. Rules there override this file if they conflict.

## Output format

### Diff mode

1. **Summary**: two or three sentences on the overall health of the change.
2. **Look at these first**: the top three findings, whatever their tier.
3. **Bug**, **Debt**, **Style**: findings grouped by tier. Each is `file:line`, new or pre-existing, what, why, Go analogy where useful.
4. **Hook and state audit**: one line per `useEffect` / `useState` / `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `useRef` touched, saying why it exists, with unjustified ones marked.
5. **Possible new rules**: any pattern seen twice in this diff that might deserve a line in `CONVENTIONS.md`. Suggest only. Do not write it.

### Audit mode

1. **Summary**: scope reviewed (paths, file count) and two or three sentences on overall health.
2. **Patterns**: one entry per pattern, ordered by tier then occurrences. Each has the tier, a name, the count, what and why (with Go analogy where useful), and every `file:line`.
3. **Unjustified hooks and state**: only the ones with no good reason to exist.
4. **Suggested fix order**: numbered, with a one-line reason for each step.
5. **Possible new rules**: patterns that recur enough to deserve a line in `CONVENTIONS.md`. Suggest only.
