## Stack

### Backend
- Language: Go
- Framework: Echo
- ORM: GORM
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Auth: Kinde
- Storage: Cloudflare R2
- Logging: Zap
- Observability: OpenTelemetry

### Frontend
- Framework: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- UI primitives: `@base-ui/react`

---

## UI Components

- We use shadcn/ui with Base UI as the primitive layer (this is shadcn's default, not a custom override).
- shadcn CLI-generated components, file structure, and styling conventions apply as normal.
- API differences from Radix: use `onClick` not `onSelect` on `ContextMenuItem`. If unsure, check @base-ui-components/react docs, not Radix docs.
- Do NOT import from @radix-ui/* packages.

## Linting

Do not suppress ESLint findings with `eslint-disable` comments — fix the underlying issue instead.

Exceptions (add a comment explaining why when using these):
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`

## Backend Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
backend/
  internal/
    domain/          ← entities and value objects; no dependencies on other layers
    usecase/         ← business logic; defines interfaces for everything it depends on
    repository/      ← database access; implements interfaces defined in usecase/
    handler/         ← HTTP delivery layer
      middleware/    ← HTTP-specific middleware
    worker/          ← background job workers (River queue)
    platform/        ← cross-cutting infrastructure; startup concerns only
      config/        ← environment/config parsing
      observability/ ← OpenTelemetry, logging, metrics setup
    testutil/        ← integration test helpers
  pkg/               ← generic utilities with no app-specific knowledge
```

### Interfaces

Interfaces are defined by their consumer, in the consumer's package.

The usecase layer defines every interface it depends on — repositories, external
services, anything it calls. Implementing packages satisfy the interface without
importing from `usecase/`.

**File placement inside `usecase/`:**
- Inline in the usecase file if: ≤ 2 methods AND used only by that file
- Separate file named `<resource>_<dependency>.go` if: > 2 methods OR shared across usecases

**Visibility:** all interfaces are exported (public), regardless of placement. The placement rule already signals scope; visibility does not need to carry a second meaning.

### Package placement

**`internal/`** — default for all app code. Any package that imports from
`internal/domain`, `internal/platform/config`, uses app credentials, or is
otherwise coupled to this codebase stays here.

**`pkg/`** — zero app-specific knowledge; could be dropped into any Go project
unchanged. Requires a deliberate decision to promote. Do not place packages here
speculatively.

**`handler/middleware/`** — HTTP middleware only. If other transports are added
(e.g. gRPC), their middleware lives under that transport's directory, not at the
top level of `internal/`.

### Exceptions

`repository/` may contain ORM infrastructure files (e.g. a custom GORM logger)
alongside repository implementations. These do not need to move to `platform/`.

## Backend Testing

### Philosophy

Test usecase behaviour, not structure. A test that only verifies a method was called, or that an error passed through unchanged, tests implementation — not correctness. Integration tests cover real outcomes; unit tests cover logic that lives exclusively in the usecase.

### Layer coverage

| Layer | Test type |
|---|---|
| `usecase/` | Unit tests |
| `handler/` | Unit tests |
| `repository/` | Integration tests only — no unit tests |

### What to test in usecases

**Happy path** — only if the usecase adds assembly or transformation. If the function delegates to a repo and returns the result unchanged, the happy path is covered by integration tests.

Worth testing:
- Assembling a composite result from multiple sources
- Computing a derived value (path construction, filename, cursor)
- Conditional output based on branching logic

**Exception:** external services not backed by integration tests. Happy paths that assemble results from these are worth unit testing even without transformation, because there is no integration fallback.

**Error path** — only if the usecase adds behaviour to the error:
- Wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- Mapping to a domain sentinel: `ErrInvalidFolderName`, `ErrDuplicateTagName`
- Side effects or conditional logic triggered on the error path

Do not write error path tests for pure pass-through (`if err != nil { return nil, err }` with no other logic).

### What not to test

- Pure delegation — function calls one dependency and returns the result unchanged
- Error pass-through — `return nil, err` with no wrapping, mapping, or side effects
- Logging side effects — not verifiable in unit tests

### Test doubles

**Use a fake** when the test requires setting up pre-state in a dependency AND asserting post-state. The signal is: the function reads existing state to decide what to write.

```go
// AcceptSuggestion reads whether a folder exists → branches → writes image folder assignment
// Fake starts with: folder "Nature" exists or doesn't
// Fake ends with:   image is in folder "Nature"
// Assert the outcome, not the call graph
```

**Use a value-return spy** for everything else — single-step operations, external services, and cases where what got called IS the verifiable behaviour (e.g. confirming a no-op skipped a write).

Test doubles implement only the narrow interface defined by the consuming usecase — not the full repository interface. If the usecase defines `type imageCounter interface { CountByFolderID(...) }`, the test double implements only that one method.

### Table-driven tests

Use TDT when all of the following are true:
- 3 or more scenarios
- All cases share identical setup structure
- Cases differ only in inputs, outputs, or expected errors

Use individual `t.Run` blocks when cases need different setup, or when there are fewer than 3 scenarios. Do not stretch TDT to fit cases with varying mock configurations.

### Assertion quality

- Assert the result, not just the error
- Failure scenarios must assert the specific error type or message — not just that an error occurred
- Use `require.ErrorIs` for sentinel errors, `require.ErrorContains` for message matching

### Repository integration tests

Repository tests run against a real database via testcontainers. They verify the **database contract** — what each method promises about its interaction with the schema.

**Always test:**

- **Query correctness** — the right records are returned with the right fields, including preloaded associations where applicable
- **Ownership / user isolation** — a record belonging to user A is not accessible to user B. This is a security property and the most commonly missing test. Methods that scope by `userID` must have a wrong-user case asserting `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound`
- **Soft delete semantics** — soft-deleted records are excluded from standard queries and visible only in explicit trash/deleted queries
- **Constraint behaviour** — unique constraints return the expected error; FK violations are caught
- **Cascade behaviour** — `DeleteWithCascade` and similar operations verify that related rows are actually affected

**Do not test:**

- Infrastructure failures by closing the DB connection — this tests the driver, not the contract. Drop any test that forces an error by calling `sqlDB.Close()`

**Assertion style** — use `require` / `assert` from testify throughout. Do not use bare `if err != nil { t.Fatalf }` checks.

### Test double placement

| Double | Location | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Fakes (repository interfaces) | `usecase/fakes_test.go` | shared across test files in the package; real logic should not be duplicated |
| Spies (external services) | inline in `*_test.go` | small, vary per scenario, no sharing benefit |
| Spies (handler usecase mocks) | inline in `handler/*_test.go` | per-handler interfaces, nothing to share across files |

### External services

External services are thin adapters over third-party systems. They delegate directly to an SDK or HTTP client with no domain logic.

- No unit tests on the implementation — correctness depends on the external system, not on code in this repo
- When used as a dependency in usecase tests, always use a value-return spy
- Integration tests only if the adapter contains non-trivial logic worth verifying against the real system

### Handler tests

The handler's job is: parse request → extract auth → call usecase → map errors → serialize response. Tests verify that plumbing is correct.

**Always test:**
- Happy path — assert both the HTTP status code and the response body shape. The handler assembles the HTTP response; that assembly is handler logic even when the usecase result passes through unchanged.
- Each distinct error mapping — `ErrInvalidFolderName → 400`, `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound → 404`, generic error → 500. Each unique mapping is a test case.
- Binding failures — malformed JSON body, invalid UUID path param.

**Request parsing** — handler tests may assert what was passed down to the usecase spy (e.g. `lastDescription`, `lastUpdateParams`) when the interesting logic is in how the handler parses or extracts the request. This is behavioral for the handler layer.

**Test doubles** — always value-return spies for usecase dependencies. Fakes are not used at the handler layer.

**No equivalent of "pure delegation, drop the test"** — even a handler that returns 204 with no body has error mapping worth testing.
